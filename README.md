## Probabilistic embeddings on taxonomies

Learning representations of symbolic data such as texts and graphs is an integral part of 
machine learning practice with broad applications in information extraction.  
However, many embedding methods in Euclidean space fail to account for the hierarchical 
structure inherent in many symbolic datasets such as with ontologies and knowledge graphs.
Our work seeks to explore techniques such as Probabilistic Embeddings with Box Lattice 
measures[1], to induce taxonomies and relational graphs.  The internship project will 
expand upon current techniques with an opportunity to explore and develop other 
non-euclidean techniques for hierarchical embeddings [2, 3].
